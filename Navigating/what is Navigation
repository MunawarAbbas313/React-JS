### **What is Navigation?**
Navigation refers to the process of moving between different sections or pages of a website or application. It allows users to access various parts of a website efficiently. 

### **How Does Navigation Work?**
Navigation typically works using **links** or **routes**:
- In **traditional websites (HTML)**, navigation is achieved using `<a>` tags that link to different HTML pages.
- In **modern web applications (React, Next.js, etc.)**, navigation is handled by routing libraries like React Router or Next.js’s built-in router. Instead of loading a new HTML file, the app dynamically updates content without reloading the page (SPA - Single Page Application behavior).

### **Difference Between Navigation in HTML and React**

| Feature | HTML Navigation | React Navigation |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Method** | Uses `<a href="page.html">` links | Uses `react-router-dom` or Next.js Router |
| **Page Reload** | Reloads the entire page | Does not reload the page, only updates components (SPA) |
| **Performance** | Slower due to full page reload | Faster due to client-side routing |
| **State Preservation** | Loses state on page reload | Preserves state since it doesn’t reload |
| **Implementation** | `<a href="about.html">About</a>` | `<Link to="/about">About</Link>` (React Router) |

### **Example**
#### **HTML Navigation**
```html
<a href="about.html">Go to About Page</a>
```
- Clicking this link will reload the page.

#### **React Navigation (React Router)**
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/about">Go to About Page</Link>
      </nav>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

export default App;
```
- Clicking this link **does not reload the page**, only the component updates.
