### 📌 Important Things About React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to break the UI into reusable pieces. Here’s everything you need to know:

---

### 🔹 **Types of Components in React**

#### 1️⃣ **Functional Components** (Recommended)
- These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX (React's syntax for UI elements).
- They **do not** use classes.
- They can use **React Hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects.

✅ **Example of a Functional Component:**
```jsx
import React from "react";

const Greeting = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, React Beginner! 🚀</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

---

#### 2️⃣ **Class Components** (Older Approach)
- These use ES6 class syntax and extend `React.Component`.
- They have a `render()` method that returns JSX.
- They can manage state using `this.state`.

✅ **Example of a Class Component:**
```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, React Beginner! 🚀</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```
🔴 **Note:** Functional components + Hooks are now preferred over class components.

---

### 🔹 **Component Lifecycle**
(Only applicable to **Class Components**)
- **Mounting** → When a component is created (`componentDidMount`).
- **Updating** → When state or props change (`componentDidUpdate`).
- **Unmounting** → When a component is removed (`componentWillUnmount`).

---

### 🔹 **Props vs State**
- **Props** → Used to pass data from a parent to a child component (read-only).
- **State** → Used to manage component-specific data that changes over time.

✅ **Example of Props:**
```jsx
const Welcome = (props) => {
  return <h1>Welcome, {props.name}!</h1>;
};

// Usage
<Welcome name="John" />
```

✅ **Example of State:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### 🔹 **Other Key Concepts**
✔ **JSX** → JavaScript syntax extension for writing UI in React.  
✔ **Hooks** → Functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` that enhance functional components.  
✔ **Conditional Rendering** → Rendering UI elements based on conditions.  
✔ **Lists & Keys** → Rendering lists dynamically with `.map()` in React.  
✔ **Context API** → For global state management (alternative to Redux).
