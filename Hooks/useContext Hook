Instead of using props drilling we can use Context Api
steps :
There are two sides 
// Provider side form where we throw values to the components 
Step 1 : first Import createContext from react at the provider component 
import {createContext} from "react"
Step 2: create a varible to store the state value of varible its part of JS ES6 
const userContext = createContext();
the variable name can be of your choice 
then Export the function 
export userContext;
Step 3 :
Wrap the element in which you want to throw the values
< variable name just created . Provier value = {value that has to thrown}>
</ close>

< userContext.Provider value = {user} >
<component user = {user}
</ userContext.Provider>




// Now for the Consumer Side 

Step 1 Import
Import the useContext hook to use the Creared context
import useContext from 'react'

Step 2 :
import the context ceated in the component
import userContext from Component

Step 3 : 
store the imported context in a varable by passing the context created as a parameter to useContexr

const user = useContext(userContext);
